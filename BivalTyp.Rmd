# Introduction

From the [BivalTyp website](https://www.bivaltyp.info):

> BivalTyp is a typological database of bivalent verbs and their encoding frames. As of 2024, the database presents data for 129 languages, mainly spoken in Northern Eurasia. The database is based on a questionnaire containing 130 predicates given in context. Language-particular encoding frames are identified based on the devices (such as cases, adpositions, and verbal indices) involved in encoding two predefined arguments of each predicate (e.g. ‘Peter’ and ‘the dog’ in ‘Peter is afraid of the dog’). In each language, one class of verbs is identified as transitive. The goal of the project is to explore the ways in which bivalent verbs can be split between the transitive and different intransitive valency classes.

# Getting the data

The data from BivalTyp are available in a GitHub repository created and maintained by [
Dmitry Nikolayev](https://dnikolaev.com):

* https://github.com/macleginn/bivaltyp

First, let's figure out where the [raw data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_data) are.

***

Here we find a number of [CSV tabular data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files:

* https://github.com/macleginn/bivaltyp/tree/master/data

What are in these data files? Let's explore them.

***

OK, now how do we load the data into R/RStudio?

***

One way is to download them to your computer.

![Open RStudio.](figures/download.png)

But then you need to make sure that they are:

1. Either in the same folder as the Rmd file you are working on (which means you've set the working directory to where you Rmd file is):

```{r, message=FALSE}
valency <- read_tsv('data_for_download.csv')
```

2. You load the file from the working directory to where the data file is, e.g.:

```{r, message=FALSE}
valency <- read_tsv('data/data_for_download.csv')
```

3. If the data are available online, e.g., in a GitHub repository (or elsewhere), you can load the data directly into R/RStudio with the ``url()`` function and a URL:

```{r, message=FALSE}
valency <- read_tsv(url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macleginn/bivaltyp/master/data/data_for_download.csv'))
```

But be careful -- it has to be the URL to the **raw data**, not the webpage! Click on the "Raw" button in GitHub to get the URL in the browswer window.

Another issue to remember -- although the file is labeled CSV for "comma separated values", the actual file is separated by tabs. Linguists often use TSV (i.e., tab separated values) for display purposes.

In R/RStudio you can specify the [delimiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter), e.g., that it is tab instead of comma. Comma is the default standard, but in the wild you will come across many different characters as delimiters.

Finally, notice, the file we started with is called `data_for_download.csv`. This is which is not a very informative label for an R object. We pick a more telling name, e.g. `valency`.

# Explore the data

Every time you read in a data set, it's a good idea to have a look at it from a few angles to make sure that there are no major issues with both the import and the data themselves before you move on to doing some real statistics.

Let's start by looking at the variables with the function `str()` (it stands for "structure"):

```{r, message = FALSE}
str(valency)
```

Another way to get some sense of the data is to use the function `head()`:

```{r, message = FALSE}
head(valency)
```


Could you guess what the "sibling" function `tail()` does?

Interpret the output of `str()` and `head()`:

- How many variables are in the dataset?

- Variables of which type are these?

- How many rows does it contain?

- Which variables are you likely to use for statistical analysis and which we probably won't need for it? 

(When a dataset has many variables it might be more convenient to work with a smaller version of it containing just what you need.)

# `select` what you need

The dataset `valency` contains a lot of textual data (examples and their translations), which won't be used for any statistical analysis. 

Let's use the `tidyverse` function `select` and select only the variables you might need for further analysis: you just list them one after another as arguments of the function  `select()`. 

Here we overwrite the object `valency`. (Do not panic, you always have access to the original dataset in case you need it.)

```{r, message = FALSE}
valency <- valency  %>% select(language_no, predicate_no, X, Y, locus, valency_pattern)
```

It's a good idea to check with the familiar functions whether you got what you wanted. Notice an optional argument `n = 3` added to the function `head()`. What does it do? Verify your intuition by changing the value to e.g. `n = 5`.

```{r, message = FALSE}
head(valency, n = 3)
```

# On character and factor data types

To get a first idea of how much of everything is in the dataset, the function `summary()` is quite useful: 

```{r, message = FALSE}
summary(valency)
```

As it turns out, `summary()` on character data (our `X`, `Y`, `locus`, and `valency_pattern`) does not yield much of use. Why is this the case?

In R, there is an important distinction between the two data types for storing textual data (i.e. data with words): character and factor. 

We use **character** for textual data which do not represent categories/classes, e.g. example sentences and their glosses in the original large valency dataset. Textual data which represent classes or categories should be stored as **factors** in R and not as character data type. 

For instance, in a patients dataset, patient names would be stored as characters, as we don't really care how many `John`'s and `Rose`'s are there and whether they are more frequent than `Lee`'s and	`Monica`'s. On the other hand, `male` and `female` are categories from a list which includes these and other possibilities which we would like to be able to count for statistical analysis, for this reason we treat them as factors in R.

Different functions to import data into R have different default specifications: some generously treat all words as factors, others conservatively treat all words as characters. What does the function `read_tsv()` (or `read_csv()`) do? It assume that all words are character and then it is up to you to declare which ones should be factors. Let's declare that `X`, `Y`, `locus`, and `valency_pattern` are actually factors: 

Let's mutate to factor the variable `X`

```{r, message = FALSE}
valency <- valency %>% mutate(X = factor(X))
```

Compare the now factor `X`  to the still character variable `Y`:

```{r, message = FALSE}
summary(valency)
```


```{r, message = FALSE}
valency %>% mutate(X = factor(X), Y = factor(Y), locus = factor(locus), valency_pattern = factor(valency_pattern))
```

```{r, message = FALSE}
summary(valency)
```

At this stage you probably realize that we have no idea what languages and what predicates you are dealing with in this table. These details are part of two separate datasets and before we embark on any serios exploration, we need to join these datasets.
