# Introduction

Topics to get up-to-speed:

* What is data? We use table data!
* What is "data wrangling" and the "tidyverse"?
* What are data types?

The materials below are very detailed and meant also as a reference.

At the end, you will find cheat sheets as usual.


# Table data

In this course, we are mainly going to be dealing with data in [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) and structured data in rectangular format, also known as **tabular data**. Here are some descriptions ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(information)), [2](https://papl.cs.brown.edu/2016/intro-tabular-data.html), [3](https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-model/)).

Tabular data **can be stored in many ways**, e.g.:

* [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)
* [Excel sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel)
* [Google sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Sheets)
* [Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_(spreadsheet))
* [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite)
* [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)

Which of these formats above are stored in plain text?

***

In a table data format, every:

* **Column** represents a particular variable (e.g., a person's height, number of of vowels)

* **Row (record)** corresponds to a given member of the data set in question (e.g. a person, in a language). 

If any row is lacking information for a particular column, a missing value (`NA`) is stored in that cell.

![Variables and observations in a table](figures/table_example.png)

***

Are there any missing values above?

<!--
Tabular data are inherently rectangular and cannot have "[ragged rows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_matrix)". 
-->

***

For most people working with small amounts of data, the data table is the fundamental unit of organization because it is both a way of organizing data that can be processed by humans and machines. 

In practice, to enter, organize, modify, analyze, and store data in tabular form -- it is common for people to use spreadsheet applications. You are probably familiar with Excel spreadsheets. 

Many statistical software packages use similar spreadsheets and many are able to import Excel spreadsheets. R is no different.

***

Table data has several properties. It consists of [rows and columns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_and_column_vectors) in the linear algebra sense, and [rows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_(database)) and [columns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_(database)) in the relational database sense.

* [Columns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_(database)) in tabular data contain a set of data of a particular type and contain (typically) one value (data type -- see above) for each row in the table. 

* Each [row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_(database)) in the table contains an observation, in which each row represents a set of related data, i.e., every row has the same structure and each cell in each row should adhere to the column's specification (i.e., that data type of that column).

*** 

In sum:

* Every **column** represents a particular variable (height, weight, number of vowels).

* Each **row/record** corresponds to a given member of the data set in question (e.g. a person, a sentence, a language, a phoneme, a measurement).

* Every record shares the same set of variables, i.e., **every row has the same set of column headers**.

* Tabular data are **inherently rectangular** and cannot have "ragged rows".

* Each value (each cell) is **known as a datum**.

* If any row is lacking information for a particular column a **missing value (NA)** must be stored in that cell.

***

# Wide vs long table formats

There are two basic presentations of tabular data:

* Wide
* Long (aka narrow)


## Wide

[Wide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data) tabular data is unstacked and it is presented so that each different data variable is in a separate column.

```{r}
# This is code to create a data frame (table) in R
df_wide <- data.frame(Person = c('Bob', 'Alice', 'Steve'),
                 Age = c(32, 24, 64),
                 Weight = c(168, 150, 144),
                 Height = c(180, 175, 165))

# This is one way of viewing that table
df_wide %>% kable()
```

<!-- if you want to do it by hand in .md insert this:

| Person | Age | Weight | Height |
|----------|--------|---| 
| Bob | 32 | 168 | 180 |
| Alice	| 24 | 150 | 175 |
| Steve | 64 | 144 | 165 |

-->


## Long

[Long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data) tabular data is stacked, so that one column contains all of the values and an additional column denotes the context of those values, e.g.:

```{r}
# This is code to create a data frame (table) in R
df_long <- data.frame(Person = c('Bob', 'Bob', 'Bob', 'Alice', 'Alice', 'Alice', 'Steve', 'Steve', 'Steve'),
                      Variable = c('Age', 'Weight', 'Height', 'Age', 'Weight', 'Height', 'Age', 'Weight', 'Height'),
                      Value = c(32, 168, 180, 24, 150, 175, 64, 144, 165))

df_long %>% kable()
```

Why do people use long format? It looks more difficult to work with manually. 

***

One important reason is that it is a data model that encodes data in a space-efficient manner. 

For example, if you have a [sparse matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) in wide format, you may have lots of `NA` or `0` cells. 

In long format, you can simply leave those out (because you can infer them when translating from long to wide format). 

This long data format basically encodes what is called an [entity-attribute-value data model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity–attribute–value_model). 

Similar data models are used in all kinds of applications, such as [knowledge graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph), in search engines, [graph databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database), and so on.


## "Tidy data" in R

The `tidyverse` works on [tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html), i.e., a consistent way to organize data in R. 

One of the goals of the `tidyverse` suite of tools is to make an interface between data input and data output -- that is, once you have data in the tidy data format, working with the tools in the tidyverse become much simpler. 

**In other words, to play and have fun with the tools in tidyverse, you should first get your data into the tidy format.**

As shown above, the same tabular data can be formatted in different ways. (The picture is actually more complex because data can be represented in many different ways in tables, e.g., [see here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html).)

**To create tidy data, there are three rules you must follow [@WickhamGrolemund2016]:**

1. Each variable must have its own column.
2. Each observation must have its own row.
3. Each value must have its own cell.

<!--
So, variables in columns, observations in rows, values in cells -- in one table! 

This boils down to: put your data in a table (or data frame or tibble in R) and put each variable in a column.
-->

# Data wrangling

So how do we explore our data in R?

<!-- 
[Data wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) is the process(es) of cleaning, structuring (aka transforming), and enriching data into a format that allows one to do things like visualization and analysis. 

Typically, [raw data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_data) is converted into structured data. During this process, raw data often need to be cleaned, organized, and transformed into formats that allow for data analysis, i.e., converted into data formats or data structures that can be fed directly into functions for code or statistical analysis.

Here's a [visualization of the process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling#/media/File:Data_Wrangling_From_Messy_To_Clean_Data_Management.jpg) of converting raw data to formatted (or structured) data:

![Visualization of data wrangling](figures/Data_Wrangling_From_Messy_To_Clean_Data_Management.jpg)

***

Broadly speaking, the steps in data wrangling include:

* **Explore your data** -- look at and think about your data and maybe come up with some questions to ask.

* **Structure your data** -- organize the data (necessarily if its in a raw format) and structure it for the functions or methods that will take it as input.

* **Clean your data** -- in the process of dealing with data (especially raw data), you may need to clean it, e.g., get all the dates into the same format (Feb 1 vs 2/1 vs 1/2 etc.).

* **Enrich your data** -- do you need more data for your analysis? E.g., you have a list of languages but you need to know where they are spoken to plot them on a world map.

* **Validate your data** -- basically making sure that your structured and cleaned data is actually structured and clean -- also commonly refereed to as [data validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_validation) and in software development, 
[software testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing).

* **Publish your data** -- publish your analysis, findings, etc., for consumption, reproducibility, archiving, etc.


# Data wrangling in R

--> 

Here is a visualization of how the data science workflow works in the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) within the so-called [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org):

* https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html

![Typical data science project workflow](figures/WickhamGrolemund.png)

That is you:

1. **Load** (aka "import") your data into R -- this entails that the data is already in a loadable format (e.g., text, CSV file, Excel spreadsheet, relational database).

2. **Tidy** the data -- in terms of the R [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), i.e., a set of R packages aimed to make data science easy (more on this below).

3. **Transform** your data -- select the data of interest, extend your data by adding other data source(s), summarize results.

4. **Visualize** your data -- create plots to explore and interact with your data and to develop questions to answer.

5. **Model** your data -- to answer questions and hypotheses.

6. **Communicate** your results -- through scientific reports like we the ones we are developing in class.

All of these steps fall under the rubric of [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming). You may not become expert computer programmers, or software engineers, but in this course will need to be able to do some basic coding in R. 

**Keep in mind: you do not need to be an expert coder, or programmer, to do data science!**

## tidyverse

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) includes several R [packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) for data science. 

We may not use all of them in this class, but they currently include:

* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org): for creating graphics
* [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org): for data manipulation
* [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org): to make your data tidy
* [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org): for reading / loading data
* [purr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org): enhancements for functional programming
* [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org): update of the R [data frame](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/data.frame.html)
* [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org): functions for working with strings
* [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org): functions for dealing with [factors](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/factor.html) in R

To load the `tidyverse` package, which then includes all the libraries above, first install it and then load:

```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# install.packages("tidyverse") # run this first if you need to install tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
```


## Loading data

There are numerous ways to load data into R. The most common way is in base R, e.g.:

```{r}
phoible <- read.csv("data/phoible.csv")
```

The `readr` package in the the `tidyverse` library also lets us read in plain text data in various formats. The most common for text-based tables are:

| Function | Format | Filename typically ends with |
|----------|--------|---| 
| read_csv | comma separated values|  csv |
| read_tsv | tab delimited separated values | tsv |

Here is an example:

```{r}
phoible <- read_csv('data/phoible.csv')
```

Notice the difference between `read.csv` and `read_csv`. What is it? How can you compare the `str()` of the two?

For the latter, do you need to change data types on the character columns?

<!--

The `readr` is the `tidyverse` library that lets us read in plain text data in various formats:

| Function | Format | Filename typically ends with |
|----------|--------|---| 
| read_table | white space separated values | txt |
| read_csv | comma separated values|  csv |
| read_csv2 | semicolon separated values | csv |
| read_tsv | tab delimited separated values | tsv |
| read_delim | general text file format, must define delimiter | txt |

Below we will load some csv data and have a look at it.

-->

For loading Excel spreadsheets, we can use `tidyverse` with the [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org) package.

This means you have to load both R libraries:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

Popular functions for reading Excel data are:


| Function | Format | Filename typically ends with |
|----------|--------|---| 
| read_excel | auto detect the format | xls, xlsx|
| read_xls | original format |  xls |
| read_xlsx | new format | xlsx |

<!-- 

There are also load functions in "base" R. It contains similar functions to `tidyverse` functions, e.g., `read.csv`, `read.table`. They load data slightly differently and into different data types.

```{r}
df <- read_csv('data/athletes.csv')
class(df)
str(df)
```

One reason that people choose a library like `readr::read_csv` over base R's `read.csv` is because the latter automatically converts strings to factors. If you use base R's `read.csv` and want to keep strings as factors, you have to additionally set the parameter `stringsAsFactors` to FALSE, i.e.:

```{r}
df <- read.csv('data/athletes.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
class(df)
str(df)
```
-->


## Accessing and mainpulating data

Once you've loaded a data set into a data frame (or [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org)), you can begin to work with it.

<!-- `dplyr` was developed by [Hadley Wickham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_Wickham) (the author of `plyr`, `ggplot2, etc.`). He also co-wrote a great introduction on the topic, look at [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) [@WickhamGrolemund2016], specifically the section [dplyr basics](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html?q=dplyr#dplyr-basics).-->

`dplyr` is a library in the `tidyverse` that contains five basic "verbs" or functions for accessing table data

* `select()`: for selecting ("subsetting") variables/columns

* `arrange()`: for re-ordering rows

* `mutate()`: for adding new columns

* `summarize()` (or `summarise()` if you prefer [British spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences)): for reducing each group to a smaller number of summary statistics

* `group_by()`: group an existing table into a grouped table, where operations are applied to each group (usually used in conjunction with another function, such as `summarize()`)

* `filter()`: for filtering ("subsetting") rows

Let's try them out!


## Some examples

Note here is an abbreviated and less detailed version of this section:

- [athletes.md]

***

Let's use the data set `athletes.csv` for an example of working with some of `tidyverse` tools. 

The data set `athletes.csv` contains various details about the athletes who participated in the [2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Winter_Olympics). Here we use the version of this data set converted by [Dana Silver](https://www.danasilver.org/sochi/). The data was originally retrieved in [JSON format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) from Kimono Lab's Sochi API on February 18, 2014.

<!-- When we load tabular (or table) data, we will usually be using the R data frame. A data frame is a table in which columns contain values of one data type and each row contains a set of values of that data type. The data frame is the most common way of storing data in R. ([Under the hood](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/under_the_hood), data frames are a list of equal length vectors -- each element of the list can be thought of as a column and the length of each element of the list is its number of rows.) Data frames have the following characteristics:

* Column names should not be empty
* Row names should be unique
* Data stored in the data frame can be of type numeric, factor, of character
* Each column should contain the same number of items
-->

If you are working within this repository on your local computer, you can load the data in this directory with this command:

```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
athletes <- read_csv("data/athletes.csv")
```

<!-- You can also give it the full path, depending on where the data is on your local computer. -->

Or wrap the `url` function into the `read_csv` function and load the data from online:

```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
athletes <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bambooforest/salos/main/data/athletes.csv"))
```

<!--
Note that GitHub displays well-formatted CSV files as tabular data:

* https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/blob/main/4_data_wrangling/datasets/athletes.csv

But if you want to load it from the web, you need to use the raw data (note the button on the GitHub page with the label "raw", which results in this URL:

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/main/4_data_wrangling/datasets/athletes.csv
-->


Now that you've loaded the `athletes.csv` data, let's have a look at its structure with the `str()` function:

```{r}
str(athletes)
```

<!--
Recall our discussion about [data types for computer programming](https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/tree/main/3_data#data-types-for-computer-programming) and [data types for statistics](https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/tree/main/3_data#data-types-in-statistics).

**What kind of variables do we have in our data set?**

-->

Some variables should be converted from the data type [character](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/character.html) to [factor](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/factor.html). 


In R, a factor is a data type that is used to represent categorical data, while a character data type is used to represent text data. We discuss these below.

```{r}
athletes$gender <- as.factor(athletes$gender)
athletes$sport <- as.factor(athletes$sport)
athletes$country <- as.factor(athletes$country)
```

Now note the change in data type:

```{r}
str(athletes)
```

<!-- 
Also, recall our discussion about [tabular data](https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/tree/main/3_data#tabular-data).

What are the variables in `athletes`?

What are the objects of observation?

If any row is lacking information for a particular column, a missing value called `NA` will be inserted in that cell.
-->


One useful function is `summary()`, which will summarize the contents of the data frame.

```{r}
summary(athletes)
```

Now some functions that we can select, filter, transform, extract, and summarize aspects of the data.


### `select()`

<!--
The data set contains the details on age, birth date, gender, height, name, weight, medal counts, sport, and country and a few more variables. Not all of these variables are of interest for a specific research question and often one wants to have a "narrower" version of a data set which contains only the variables of immediate interest. 

To prepare such a version of your data set, use the function `select()` to select the variables (columns) you need.
-->

First, you can select the variables of interest just by naming them. Note that this way you can also modify the order of the variables:

```{r}
select(athletes, name, height, weight)
```

- You can use `:` to select all columns in a range between two specified columns (inclusively):
 
```{r}
select(athletes, age:weight)
```

- You can exclude a variable with the help of `-`.

```{r}
select(athletes, -birthdate, -age)
```

Note that `dplyr` functions never modify their input data frames. If you want to save the result e.g., of the `select()`function, you need to use the assignment operator ` <-` and either overwrite the original data frame or create a new one. 

For instance, here the original data frame remains unchanged: 

```{r}
select(athletes, birthdate, age)
athletes
```

And here we create a new data frame (table) with the selected columns only:

```{r}
athletes_age <- select(athletes, birthdate, age)
athletes_age
```

<!--
There are a number of **helper functions** you can use within `select()`. Try to guess what they do before executing the commands:

1. **`ends_with()`**

```{r}
select(athletes, ends_with("medals"))
```

2. **`contains()`**

```{r}
select(athletes, contains("eigh"))
```

3. For details on other helper functions, see `?select`.

```{r}
?select
```
-->

### `arrange()`

`arrange()` changes the order of the rows. It takes a data frame and a set of column names to order by. If you list more than one column name, each additional column is used to break ties in the values of preceding columns.

1. Guess what the following code will do before executing it!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
arrange(athletes, height, age)
```

<!-- The data set is first order in an ascending order by `height`. In case two or more athletes have the same height, `age` is used to break ties (also in ascending order), e.g. several athletes have the height of 1.50 cm, they are then order from youngest to oldest. -->

2. Guess what the following code will do before executing it!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
arrange(athletes, desc(height), age)
```

<!-- The data set is first order in a descending order by `height`. In case two or more athletes have the same height, `age` is used to break ties (but now in ascending order), e.g. among the tallest athletes are the four athletes with the height of 2.00 cm, they are then order from youngest to oldest. -->

3. Use only the `arrange()` to display the oldest female athlete at the top of the sorted data set. How old is she?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
arrange(athletes, gender, desc(age))
```

<!-- Angelica Morrone is 48 years old. -->


### `mutate()`

Besides working with existing columns, it is sometimes necessary to add new columns that are functions of existing columns. That's what the `mutate()` function is for. 

`mutate()` always adds new columns at the end of your data set so we'll start by creating a narrower data set so we can see the new variables. (Remember that when you use in RStudio, an easy way to see all the columns is `View()`.)

First, create with `select()` a narrow data set `athletes_narrow` which only contains the variables `name`, `gender`, `age`, `sport`, `height`, and `weight`. (Here, we add a few more columns than we need now, because we plan to use `athletes_narrow` later).

```{r}
athletes_narrow <- select(athletes, name, gender, age, sport, height, weight)
athletes_narrow
```

Next, add the column BMI (body mass index). The BMI is calculated as the body mass (`weight`) divided by the square of the body `height`. It is universally expressed in units of kg/m^2^. 

```{r}
mutate(athletes_narrow, BMI = weight/height^2)
```

Notice that `mutate` does not overwrite the existing data frame.

```{r}
mutate(athletes_narrow, BMI = weight/height^2)
athletes_narrow
```

To add the new column to it permanently, you have to overwrite the original data frame:

```{r}
athletes_narrow <- mutate(athletes_narrow, BMI = weight/height^2)
athletes_narrow
```

There are many functions for creating new variables that you can use with `mutate()`. Think of a function and look up  [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html?q=dplyr#mutate-funs) [@WickhamGrolemund2016] for possible solutions. 


### `summarize()`

The dplyr function `summarize()` (or `summarise()`) summarizes multiple values in a single value.

Let's create a data frame as an [reproducible example](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html). What is a reproducible example:

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example
* https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example
* http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html
* https://xiangxing98.github.io/R_Learning/R_Reproducible.nb.html

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
    color = c('blue', 'black', 'blue', 'blue', 'black'),
    value = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
)

df
```

So, let's sum up the value column with `summarize()`.

```{r}
summarize(df, total = sum(value))
```

We can do the same thing with the `athletes` data frame, for example, for gold medals.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
athletes %>% summarize(totals = sum(gold_medals))
```

### `group_by()`

Groups table data into groups on which some other operation may operate. (`ungroup()` removes grouping.) This function is usually used along with some other function.

For example, an important function of `summarize()` is in coordination with the `group_by()` function. The dplyr `group_by` function take an existing data frame and performs an operation by group. For example, let's group our data frame `df` by the color column.

```{r}
df %>% group_by(color) %>% summarize(total = sum(value))
```

You can also save the results to a new data frame.

```{r}
by_color <- df %>% group_by(color) %>% summarize(total = sum(value))
by_color
```

We can also use `group_by` on the athletes data. For example, how many gold medals per country?

```{r}
athletes %>% group_by(country) %>% summarize(gold_medals = sum(gold_medals))
```

Maybe for viewing purposes it's better to arrange them by number of gold medals instead of alphabetically by country name.

```{r}
athletes %>% group_by(country) %>% summarize(gold_medals = sum(gold_medals)) %>% arrange(desc(gold_medals))
```

As we continue to [pipe](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html) commands together, i.e., putting multiple operations (aka dplyr verbs) together -- we can use [white space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character) to style the code. More on style below.

```{r}
athletes %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(gold_medals = sum(gold_medals)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(gold_medals))
```

### `filter()`

Probably the most useful `dplyr` function is `filter()`. It allows you to subset observations based on their values. Or in other words, you can extract some rows from your data set on the basis of certain conditions. The first argument of this function is the name of the data frame. The second and subsequent arguments are the expressions that filter the data frame. 

For example, we can select all athletes who are taller than 2.00 m. Here we continue to work with `athletes_narrow`:

```{r}
filter(athletes_narrow, height > 2)
```

To use `filter()` effectively, you have to know how to select the observations that you want using the comparison operators in R. The standard comparison operators are  `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=` (not equal), and `==` (equal).

The operator `==` can be used with numeric variables to filter a specific values, e.g., all athletes who are 15 years old: 

```{r}
filter(athletes_narrow, age == 15)
```

When you’re starting out with R, the easiest mistake to make is to use = instead of == when testing for equality. When this happens you’ll get an informative error. Try it out:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
filter(athletes_narrow, age = 15)
```


## Filtering NA

Another important function when filtering is to identify and potentially filter out `NA` cells. These are missing or unknown values in the data set. 

<!-- R [provides a function](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/NA.html) called `is.na()` that tests whether a value is missing or not. `NA` is a special value in R.

```{r}
x <- NA # special value NA
y <- 1 # integer
z <- 'NA' # character (string)
is.na(x)
is.na(y)
is.na(z)
```
-->

Let's filter the rows in `athletes` that do not have a height value, i.e., they are `NA` in the table.

```{r}
athletes %>% filter(is.na(height))
```

You can also filter to **remove** `NA`s, which is often useful for when you want to visualize the data. Use the logical operation `!` mentioned above, i.e., "not".

```{r}
athletes %>% filter(!is.na(height))
```

You can also combined the filters. For example, if you want all rows in `athletes` that do not have `NA` values for `height` and `weight`. Notice how the number of rows decreases.

```{r}
athletes %>% filter(!is.na(height)) %>% filter(!is.na(weight))
```

If you want to check if there are any `NA`s in a column, you can also use the `any()` function.

```{r}
any(is.na(athletes$height))
any(is.na(athletes$age))
```

***

## The table function

Another useful function is called `table()`. What does it do?

```{r}
table(athletes$sport)
```

Note you need to use the `exclude = FALSE` parameter, if you want the `table()` function to count `NA`s. How many athlete

```{r}
table(athletes$height)
table(athletes$height, exclude = FALSE)
```

***

## Some practice problems

Use the data frame `athletes_narrow`.

1. Filter all the athletes who are heavier than 110 kg.

2. Filter the athletes who weigh exactly 110 or more kg. How many athletes are these? To get the answer, use the function `nrow()` for **n**umber of **row**s' in addition to `filter()` (i.e. `nrows(filter(...))`). We recommend though looking first at the filter output to be sure that it worked the way you intended before applying `nrow()`.

3. Filter all the athletes who weigh between 105 and 110 kg. How many are they?


# Data types

Tabular data typically contains numerical data or [categorical data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable) (see data types discussed below). Numerical data is either:

* Numerical (aka discrete) -- integer values, e.g., counts, indices.
* Continuous -- data that can take any value within in interval, e.g., temperature.

[Categorical data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable) represents sets of values that represent possible categories. They are not subject to the laws of arithmetic (but note they can be counted. Categorical data includes:

* Binary -- dichotomous data, i.e., True vs False (often encoded 1 vs. 0).
* Ordinal -- categorical data with explicit ordering, e.g., grades, ranks, 5-star reviews.

The types of data in your table, i.e., the [statistical data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_data_type) **constrain or determine the types of statistics you can do with your data!** See data types discussion below.


<!--
# Data types

[Data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type) for computer programming typically refer to various *types* of data that can be interpreted by the computer's [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler). In programming languages, these include types such as:

* [Integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_(computer_science))
* [Floats (floating point numbers)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic)
* [Characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)) -- ask me about these
* [Strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) -- sequence of characters
* [Boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type) -- two possible values (True vs False)
* [Enumerated types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type) -- categorical data, i.e., a set of values (e.g., factors in R)

In a [typed programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system), the data type provides information for the compiler to check the [correctness of the computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correctness_(computer_science)).
-->

# Data types in programming vs statistics

[Data types for computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type) have comparable types of [data types in statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_data_type) -- or how else would we use computer programs to do statistics? For example:

| Programming | Statistics |
|-------------|------------|
| [Integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_(computer_science)) | [Count data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_data) |
| [Boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type) | [Binary data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_data) |
| [Floating-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) | [Interval scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement#Interval_scale), [Ratio scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_real_numbers#Ratio_scale) |
| [Enumerated type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type) | [Categorical variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable) |
| [List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type)), [Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type) | [Random vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_random_variable) |

Why is important to keep this in mind? How you can programmatically access, perform functions or statistics on these data types -- whether in programming code or with statistical methods -- depends on what **type** of data you are dealing with. For example:

* You cannot apply arithmetic to qualitative / categorical values.
* Ordinal scales are equidistant, so you can rank them, but how much x is from y is unknown.

One last distinction to make clear is between the term "variable" in computer programming and in statistical analysis. 

A [variable in computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)) is used to store information that can be referenced and manipulated by a computer program. One assigns a value to a variable, e.g., in R:

```{r}
my_name <- 'Steven'
my_name
```

Variables can be manipulated, e.g.:

```{r}
my_full_name <- paste0(my_name, ' Moran')
my_full_name
```

Another example:

```{r}
x <- 1
y <- 1
x + y
```


# Data types in statistics

## Qualitative versus quantitative variables

In contrast to variables in computer programming, variables in statistics are **properties** or **characteristics** used to measure a population of individuals. A variable is thus a quantity whose value can change across a population.

They include:

* **Qualitative variables** -- measure non-numeric qualities and are not subject to the laws of arithmetic.
* **Quantitative variables** -- measure numeric quantities and arithmetic can be applied to them.

Qualitative variables are also call **categorical** or **discrete** variables. Quantitative variables can be measured, so that their rank or score can tell you about the degree or amount of variable.

A hierarchy of variable types in statistics is given in the image below taken from this [Stats and R](https://statsandr.com/terms/) blog.

![Variable types.](figures/variable-types-and-examples.png)

As you can see, variables in statistics can be classified into four types under qualitative and quantitative variables:

* **Nominal** -- a qualitative variable where no ordering is possible (e.g., eye color) as implied by its **levels** -- levels can be for example binary (e.g., do you smoke?) or multilevel (e.g., what is your degree -- where each degree is a level).
* **Ordinal** -- a qualitative variable in which an order is implied in the levels, e.g., if the side effects of a drug taken are measured as "light", "moderate", "severe", then this qualitative ordinal value has a clear order or ranking (but note we don't know *how* different these levels are from one to the next!).
* **Discrete** -- variables that can only take specific values (e.g., whole numbers) -- no values can exist between these numbers.
* **Continuous** -- variables can take the full range of values (e.g., floating point numbers) -- there are an infinite number of potential values between values.

Consider these examples:

* What number were you wearing in the race? -- "5"!
* What place did you finish in? -- "5"!
* How many minutes did it take you to finish? -- "5"!

The three "5"s all look the same. 

However, the three variables (identification number, finish place, and time) are quite different. Because of the differences, each "5" has a different possible interpretation.

What kind of of variables are each of these below?^[Note we set the `na` parameter of `readr::read_csv` to `na=character()` so that the blank cells in the CSV file are not interpreted as [NA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N/A), i.e., "not applicable". Note also the "_1" in the output -- ask me about it!)]

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df <- readr::read_csv('data/variables_quiz.csv', na=character())
knitr::kable(df)
```

Answers are available [here](data/variables_quiz_answers.csv).

# Data types in R

R has **five** basic [data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type):

* Integer -- whole numbers
* Numeric -- numbers with decimal points (aka doubles or floats)
* Character -- aka 'strings' (or "strings"; must have quotes around them)
* Logical -- binary value, either TRUE or FALSE
* Complex -- imaginary number (don't worry about these for this class)

Each can be assigned to a [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)). In other words, variables store data of different data types. Different data types can do different things.

Generally, R does not explicitly state what data type is being assigned but infers it from the thing (on the right) being assigned to the variable (on the left). 

```{r}
i <- 1
n <- 0.1
c <- 'string'
l <- TRUE
```

The variables can then be used or manipulated with different [operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(computer_programming)) or [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(computer_programming)).

```{r}
i + i
i + n
```

<!--
But note that not all operators or functions work with all data types.

```{r}
# We comment this line of code out because otherwise knitting this document fails.
# Below is the erorr you will get if you try to add two strings with `+`.

# c + c 
# Error in c + c : non-numeric argument to binary operator
```

If you want to [concatenate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation) two strings (two character data types) in R, there is a function called `paste()` to do so.

```{r}
paste(c, c)
paste(c, "+", c)
paste("Here is a", c, "and another", c, "and another", c, "...")
```

When you have a variable and want to check what its data type is, use the `class()` function.

```{r}
class(i)
class(n)
class(c)
class(l)
```
-->

An important set of operators when working with data types in R involve comparison.

* is equal to: `==`
* is not equal to: `!=` (exclamation point or "bang" typically means NOT in programming languages)
* less than: `<`
* greater than: `>`
* less than or equal to: `<=`
* greater than or equal to: `>=`

Some examples.

```{r}
i == i
i < n
l != l
c != c

# or without variables
1 == 1
"cat" == "cats"
"cat" != "cat"
```


# Data structures in R

R has six basic [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure):

* Vector: an ordered collection of the same basic data types, i.e., 1-dimension (1D) of homogeneous data types
* List: a generic object that contain objects of different types, i.e., 1D, heterogeneous
* Matrix: a vector with attributes (called dimensions) of the same data types, i.e., 2D homogeneous
* Array: multidimensional matrices of the same data types, i.e., no dimensionality, homogeneous
* Data frame: an object consisting of columns and rows (2D, heterogeneous)


<!--
  Homogeneous	Heterogeneous
1d	Atomic vector	List
2d	Matrix	Data frame
nd	Array

add tibbles
-->

Here's a nice overview:

* https://intro2r.com/data-structures.html

When you have a sequence of the **same** data type, R calls these vectors. 

```{r}
# A vector of strings
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "orange")

# A vector of numbers
numbers <- c(1, 2, 1)

# A vector of logical values
me_likes <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```

You can print these to see their contents.

```{r}
fruits
numbers
me_likes
```

Certain functions also work on vectors.

```{r}
length(fruits)
sort(fruits)
unique(numbers)
summary(numbers)
```

Columns in your table data -- your data frame -- will consist of vectors of the same length, which may have different data types **across columns**. Here we create a data frame (tabular data object) from our vectors above.

```{r}
df <- data.frame (
  fruits,
  numbers,
  me_likes
)

df
```

Of course you can also specify the vectors within the `data.frame()` function.

```{r}
df2 <- data.frame (
  countries = c("Japan", "Germany", "UK"),
  GDP_trillions = c(4.8, 3.7, 2.6),
  population_millions = c(127, 82, 67)
)

df2
```

Like functions on vectors, certain function can be used on data frames.

```{r}
summary(df2)
```

Lastly, factors in R are used to categorize data.

```{r}
beer_types <- factor(c("IPA", "Stout", "Pilsner", "Pilsner", "Porter", "IPA", "Stout", "IPA"))
beer_types
```

Factors become important when we work with categorical variables for things like statistical testing.
