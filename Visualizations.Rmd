# Case study: Come fly with me

Which airlines should you travel with – and which should you avoid? We sift through the data so you don't have to (by James Tozer. April/May 2016):

* https://www.1843magazine.com/travel/what-the-numbers-say/come-fly-with-me

>>> For prices, we took the world's 30 busiest airports in the last quarter of 2015, and analyzed direct flights between them on week-long return trips from a sample at the start of August 2016.

>>> We used flight-volume data from FlightStats.com and customer-satisfaction data from Skytrax, an airline consultancy which asks users to mark carriers out of five for the quality of their food, service, comfort, in-flight entertainment and value for money. 

***

Some questions:

* Which airlines are the best or the worst? Why?
* Which airlines would you travel with – and which should you avoid?

# Wide vs long table formats

There are two basic presentations of tabular data:

* **Wide**: good for collecting data
* **Long** (aka narrow): good for data visualization in R

We often want to "reshape" data from wide to long (less often long to wide).

The `gather` function in the `tidyverse` library lets you convert wide data into tidy data. Let's consider an example from [this great course](https://datasciencelabs.github.io).

The annual fertility rates data from `dslabs` and `gapminder` for Germany and South Korea in wide format:

```{r, message=FALSE}
fertility_wide <- read_csv(url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafalab/dslabs/master/inst/extdata/life-expectancy-and-fertility-two-countries-example.csv'))
```

```{r}
fertility_wide %>% kable() # cool trick to make the table show up nicely!
```

What are the variables? What are the observations? How do we get the data into tidy format?

Transform the data from `wide` to `long` format by telling the `gather` function which columns we do *not* want, i.e., "-country" (minus country).

```{r}
fertility_tidy <- fertility_wide %>% 
  gather(year, fertility, -country, convert = TRUE)
```

```{r}
fertility_tidy %>% head() %>% kable()
```

Another way to convert from wide to long is with the `pivot_longer()` function. It does the same thing.

```{r}
fertility_tidy <- fertility_wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(!country)
```

```{r}
fertility_tidy %>% head() %>% kable()
```

Note the default `name` and `value` column names. These can be changed in the parameter specification of `pivot_longer()`.

```{r}
fertility_tidy <- fertility_wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(!country, names_to = "year_variable", values_to = "fertility")
```

```{r}
fertility_tidy %>% head() %>% kable()
```

***

**The data are still a bit not so user friendly. Why?**

***

There's a function for almost anything in R -- you just have to find it. The `seprate()` function for example:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
temp <- fertility_tidy %>% separate(year_variable, into=c("year", "variable"), sep="_")
```

```{r}
temp %>% head() %>% kable()
```

We lost "_expectancy", but we can correct for that (advanced).

```{r}
fertility_tidy <- fertility_tidy %>% 
  separate(year_variable, into=c("year", "variable"), sep="_", extra = "merge")
```

```{r}
fertility_tidy %>% head() %>% kable()
```


# Visualization workflow

A nice illustration of the data exploration process (or pipeline) is given [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/explore-intro.html) and in the screen shot:

![Data exploration.](figures/data_exploration.png)

In the blue highlighted portion “Explore”, you can seen a circle from “Transform” -> “Visualize” -> “Model” (then repeat).

A picture of the workflow with `tidyverse` libraries (`readr`, `tidyr`, etc.) is given below. For "model" it will depend on what type of statistical *model(s)* you are using -- there are numerous libraries for statistical modeling in R!

![Work flow annotated with Tidyverse libraries.](figures/workflow.png)


# What do I visualize?

It depends on what you want to show and what your data types are!

# Plotting in base R (beginner)

## Case study: Red wine quality

Here is a paper about modeling wine preferences by using data mining on physicochemical properties of wine:

* https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167923609001377?via%3Dihub

The authors aims to predict human wine taste preferences using a data driven approach. They do so through regression modeling and model selection techniques.

The dataset is available online:

* https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009?select=winequality-red.csv

You can find out more about the data types in dataset at these URLs, e.g., residual sugar, citric acid, density.

Let's load the data.

```{r, message=FALSE}
red_wine <- read_csv('data/winequality-red.csv')
```

What to do first? Have a look at the data!

```{r}
red_wine %>% head() %>% kable()
```

Some questions:

* What do we want to know?

* How do we visualize the data?

* What data types do we have?

* How many variables (columns) do we want to visualize?

Let's start with red wine quality, but you can use this for any single numerical value (try them out)!

```{r}
hist(red_wine$quality)
```

What about two variables (columns)?

The [box plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot) is a good choice for data exploration when you want to compare distributions.

Here is an example of [how to read a box plot](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/what-is-a-boxplot):

![How to read a box plot](figures/test_score_box_plot2.png)

![How to read a box plot](figures/test_score_box_plot.png)

***

What aspect of red wine might determine its quality rating?

In base R, the `boxplot()` function takes:

* First the y axis
* Then a tilde "~"
* Then the x-axis
* Then the data table
* Then optional labels, i.e., xlab="Blah blah blah", ylab = "..."

Let's try them out.

```{r}
boxplot(`fixed acidity` ~ quality, red_wine, xlab = "Quality", ylab = "Fixed acidity")
```



```{r}
boxplot(alcohol ~ quality, red_wine, xlab = "Quality", ylab = "Fixed acidity")
```
***

Try it for yourself and inspect the different variables (columns) on the y-axis. Also, you might be interested in comparing them with the [white wine dataset](data/winequality-white.csv)!

***

What if we want to compare **two numerical variables (columns)** and look for relationships between the two?

The classic option is the [scatter plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot).

In base R, an example (remember, y ~ x -- i.e., y axis and then x axis). Do we see a pattern?

```{r}
plot(red_wine$sulphates, red_wine$alcohol)
```

Note however here that the two variables **are in different scales** (think e.g., Celsius vs Fahrenheit)! This will be important to think about for any statistical analysis. Let's take the [logarithmic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale) of each variable and replot it. What do you see?

```{r}
plot(log(red_wine$sulphates), log(red_wine$alcohol))
```
***

Try exploring and visualizing other potential correlations between wine characteristics.

```{r}
# Insert your code here

```


# Layered graphics in ggplot2 in R (advanced)

The R tidyverse visualization library `ggplot2` is based on the principles outlined in *The Grammar of Graphics*, a classic text on data visualizations, by Leland Wilkinson [@Leland1999]. The layered *Grammar of Graphics* is where @Wickham2009 implements Wilkinson's principles, and typology, of graphic design into R.^[Thus, the "gg" in ggplot.]

Each layer/component of the *Grammar of Graphics* has a special name in `ggplot2`, visualized as:

![A layered grammar of graphics.](figures/layers.png)

A statistical graphic according to this layered grammar of graphics is a mapping from **data** to **aesthetic attributes** (e.g., color, shape, size) to geometric objects (e.g., points, lines, bars).

The basic idea is that you can build data visualizations from the same components:

* The data
* A [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system)
* Geoms (functions that represent data points in the coordinate system)

Or visually:

![A layered grammar of graphics.](figures/essential_ingredients.png)

Here is a "cheat sheet":

* https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization-2.1.pdf

***

Let's revisit the wine data with ggplot2.

```{r}
ggplot(data = red_wine, aes(x = quality)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

Pretty ugly. How about this?

```{r}
ggplot(data = red_wine, aes(x = quality)) +
  geom_histogram(color = 'black', fill = '#099DD9', binwidth = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 10), breaks = seq(0, 10, 1)) +
  xlab('Quality of Red Wine') +
  ylab('Number of Red Wines') +
  theme_bw()
```


## For advanced students

* Try to split the wine into categories programmatically (hint: split the wine quality into bins).

* Add those categories to the data frame and give them some labels (e.g., Low, Medium, High).

* Create a visualization in ggplot2 of the number of observations of those categories.

* Create box plots of those ratings (Low, Medium, High) by different aspects of the wine, e.g., do you find any correlations between acidity and wine rating? By residual sugar and wine rating? Etc.

* Try comparing three variables, e.g., alcohol vs sulfates vs quality, and visualize them.

* What about white wine?! See the white wine data set [here](data/winequality-white.csv). 

* Compare these with the red wine using facets.
