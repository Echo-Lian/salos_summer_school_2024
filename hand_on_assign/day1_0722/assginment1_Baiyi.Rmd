## Task 1

-   Load the data and calculate the means of two variables.

```{r}
library(readxl)
data <- read_excel("~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UniversityofHelsinki/internship_projects_summerschool/Salo Summer School/source_data/hand_on_assign/day1_0722/dataset.questionnaire.xlsx")
 
# check the headers
headers <- colnames(data)
cat(paste(headers, collapse = "\n"))

# check out rows and columns
rows <- nrow(data)
cols <- ncol(data)

cat("This data frame contains:", rows, "rows\n")
cat("This data frame contains:", cols, "columns\n")

# calculate the mean of the age
cat("The mean of the age is: ", mean(data$Age), "\n")

# calculate the mean of vocablulary size of the participants
cat("The mean of vocablulary size of the participants is:", mean(data$Vocabulary_size), "\n")
```

## Task 2

• Plot the distribution of the Vocabulary size scores of the participants.

• Change the color of the histogram.

• Add the title to the x-axis and the y-axis.

```{r}
# because there's only one variable, so I chose histogram
# load the library
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# plot the variable with its data
ggplot(data, aes(x = Vocabulary_size)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "darkgreen", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Vocabulary size scores of the participants",
       x = "Vocabulary size scores",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

# Here in the histogram,the binwidth is deleted to let R decides what is the best bin size. You could also manipulate with different bin sizes to see the outcome.
```

• Plot the relationship between the Vocabulary size and C-test scores

```{r}
data$'C-test'
```

```{r}
# because there are two variables that have many points, so here I chose scatter plot
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Convert to numeric and handle non-numeric values
#data$Vocabulary_size <- as.numeric(as.character(data$Vocabulary_size))
#data$`C-test` <- as.numeric(as.character(data$`C-test`))

# plot the variable with its data
ggplot(data, aes(x = Vocabulary_size, y = 'C-test')) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Vocabulary Size vs C-test Scores",
       x = "Vocabulary Size",
       y = "C-test Scores") +
  #scale_x_log10() +
  #scale_y_log10() +
  theme_minimal() +  # Applying a minimal theme for better aesthetics
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

# problem: why the dot plot looks like a stright line? Did I make something wrong?
```

• Plot the distribution of the Language of the participants.

```{r}
# because the variable is categorical and there's one, so I chose bar plot
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Plot the bar plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = Language)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +  # Fill color and border color
  labs(title = "Bar Plot of Language",
       x = "Languages",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +  # Apply a minimal theme for better aesthetics
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))  # Center the plot title

# so the bar chart shows that the languages in use are LT and PL. They are the same to each other.
```
