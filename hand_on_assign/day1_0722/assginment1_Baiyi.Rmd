## Task 1

-   Load the data and calculate the means of two variables.

```{r}
library(readxl)
data <- read_excel("~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UniversityofHelsinki/internship_projects_summerschool/Salo Summer School/source_data/hand_on_assign/day1_0722/dataset.questionnaire.xlsx")
 
# check the headers
headers <- colnames(data)
cat("These are the headers in the data frame:", headers)

# check out rows and columns
rows <- nrow(data)
cols <- ncol(data)

cat("This data frame contains:", rows, "rows")
cat("This data frame contains:", cols, "columns")

# calculate the mean of the age
cat("The mean of the age is: ", mean(data$Age))

# calculate the mean of vocablulary size of the participants
cat("The mean of vocablulary size of the participants is:", mean(data$Vocabulary_size))
```

## Task 2

• Plot the distribution of the Vocabulary size scores of the participants.

• Change the color of the histogram.

• Add the title to the x-axis and the y-axis.

```{r}
# because there's only one variable, so I chose histogram
# load the library
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# plot the variable with its data
ggplot(data, aes(x = Vocabulary_size)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "darkgreen", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Vocabulary size scores of the participants",
       x = "Vocabulary size scores",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

# Here in the histogram,the binwidth is deleted to let R decides what is the best bin size. You could also manipulate with different bin sizes to see the outcome.
```

• Plot the relationship between the Vocabulary size and C-test scores

• Plot the distribution of the Language of the participants.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
